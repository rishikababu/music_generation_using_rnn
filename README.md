# ðŸŽµ AI Music Generation using RNN
Generate music using RNN and Flask web app
A simple AI-based music generation system built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Flask.
This project enables users to generate original music sequences by using a trained RNN model. It takes input as a set of initial notes or text and produces melody-like MIDI outputs through a user-friendly web interface.

Note: This is an academic/demo project and does not include real-time sound synthesis or advanced musical production. All music generation is simulated using pre-trained models for demonstration purposes.

Also add datasets by own for training the model. 

## ðŸš€ Features
- Generate music using a trained RNN model
- Upload initial input or generate from scratch
- Download MIDI output
- Web interface with Flask

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python  
- RNN (LSTM via PyTorch or TensorFlow)  
- music21  
- Flask  
- JavaScript, HTML/CSS
